The goal is to identify category-wise product availability, pricing trends, discount patterns, and top-performing category.

## PROBLEM OBJECTIVE:
E-commerce is growing at a rapid pace, with new players entering thCloe market every day. To stay competitive and relevant, platforms like Flipkart need to constantly refine their strategies. This involves understanding which product categories and brands are most popular, how pricing impacts customer interest, and what kind of discounts drive engagement and attracts customers.
Key points to be assessed:
 * Which Category dominates the platform?
 * Concentration of products across different price ranges and their price analysis, to develop corresponding strategies.
 * Identify discount patterns across various categories.
 * How many products categorise under different popularity levels, and do they correspond to discount patterns?
 * Are popularity levels influenced by the discount amount?

## WHAT WAS DONE IN EXCEL:
 * Cleaned the raw Flipkart data to remove unnecessary columns and prepare it for analysis.
 * Created a popularity level column using the IF formula to group products based on how many products are there in each category.
